problem:
When I git pull origin master,The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge.
Why:
local version is not controlled.
How:
$ git clean -xdf //x:remove unrecognized files,d:remove the files which are not added to git path,f:force.
$ git checkout -f //discard changes in working directory.
