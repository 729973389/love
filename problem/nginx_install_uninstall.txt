install:
$ sudo apt update;sudo apt install nginx
||problem:
nginx can't find /run/nginx.pid
why:cause in it's configration file nginx.conf (which is usually in directory->usr/etc/nginx || /usr/local/
nginx/conf || /usr/local/etc/nginx),directives (pid /run/nginx.pid;) but it can't be found in /run. use shell $ps -ax | grep nginx ,but it's pid always changes:(
how:
$ sudo nginx //to creat nginx.pid in /run directory.

||
uninstall:
$ sudo apt-get purge nginx nginx-common //remove everything
$ sudo apt-get remove nginx nginx-common //remove all but config files
$ sudo apt-get autoremove //remove dependencies by nginx which are no longer required.
