problem:
I want to transform the mannul file to pdf so I can read it anywhere
why:
how:
$ man -t ${shellname} | ps2pdf - ${outputfile.pdf}  
//the flag "-t" means transform the result output to ps output,ps2pdf(by the way,it's pronounce is ps to pdf :)hhh ) get the ps input and transform it to pdf file.
